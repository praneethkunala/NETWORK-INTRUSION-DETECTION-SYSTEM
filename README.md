# NETWORK-INTRUSION-DETECTION-SYSTEM
 Nowadays with the emergence of new 
technologies such as Cloud Computing or Big Data, large amounts of network 
traffic are generated and the threat detection system must dynamically collect 
and analyze the data produced by the incoming traffic. However in a large 
dataset not all features contribute to represent the traffic, therefore reducing and 
selecting a number of adequate features may improve the speed and accuracy of 
the threat detection system.
