# NETWORK-INTRUSION-DETECTION-SYSTEM
 Nowadays with the emergence of new 
technologies such as Cloud Computing or Big Data, large amounts of network 
traffic are generated and the threat detection system must dynamically collect 
and analyze the data produced by the incoming traffic. However in a large 
dataset not all features contribute to represent the traffic, therefore reducing and 
selecting a number of adequate features may improve the speed and accuracy of 
the threat detection system. 

A feature selection mechanism has been proposed which aims to eliminate nonrelevant features as well as identify the features which will contribute to 
improve the detection rate, based on the score each feature has established 
during the selection process. To achieve that objective, a recursive feature 
elimination process was employed and associated with a decision tree based 
classifier and later on, the suitable relevant features were identified. This 
approach was applied on the NSL-KDD dataset which is an improved version of 
the previous KDD 1999 Dataset, scikit-learn that is a machine learning library 
written in python that is being planned to use. 
Using this approach, relevant features can be identified inside the dataset and 
the accuracy rate can be improved. Understanding the factors that help identify 
relevant features will allow the design of a better threat detection system.
